      Hi! I'm Alexander Wong, a New York-based software engineer.
      <br />
      I used to write articles and emails to patients, but now I write code.
      While working as an entertainment journalist and accounts receivable
      specialist, I developed a passion for creative problem-solving, learning
      new things, and collaboration. I saw all of those things in coding, and
      that led to me recently graduating from Fullstack Academy's software
      engineering immersive.
      <br />
      I'm currently looking for job opportunities. If you're interested in

      building something together, you can contact me here or email
      alex.jc.wong@gmail.com.
